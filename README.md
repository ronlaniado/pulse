## Why Pulse?

Pulse provides a clean-cut toolset to build a Javascript application quickly and efficiently. It encourges developers to construct a core library that can be dropped into any UI framework. Your `core` is the brain of your application, it will handle everything from state management, API requests to all logic and calculations. Pulse will supply pre-computed data to your UI components, in the framework of your choice with complete reactivity.

### Typescript

Pulse is written in Typescript and is designed to support it heavily. Everything is type safe out of the box and encourages you to write clean typed code.
