### Debugging

::: tip Coming soon...
We're planning to work on a dev tools for Pulse soon, if you want to contribute please join the [Discord](https://discord.gg/Huhe48c)
:::

For now to debug Pulse you'll need to use the console. Pulse is accessible directly in the console by typing `_pulse`, this is because a refrence to Pulse is bound to the `window` object.
